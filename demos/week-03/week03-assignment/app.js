//game logic
//when the user clicks on the cookie, the total count of cookies goes up by 1
//when the user clicks on the "buy" button in an upgrade in the shop, the total count of cookies goes down by the cost of the upgrade, and the cps value goes up

//we will need functions to contain the game logic
//we will get the shop upgrades data from the API: https://cookie-upgrade-api.vercel.app/api/upgrades
//to create the logic for the shop upgrades:
//- OPTION 1: you could have a function to handle each upgrade
//- OPTION 2: you could have a reusable function that works for ALL upgrades

//Tip on local storage:
//- make sure the local storage values are updated after the user buys an upgrade AND when the user clicks on the cookie

//===========================================================================

//data storage
//global scope
let totalCookieCount = 0;
let cps = 0;

// let stats = {
//   cookieCount: 0,
//   cps: 0,
// };

//if there is data already in local storage, update stats with this data, so the user picks it up where they left off

//============================================================================

//shop upgrades

//fetch the upgrades form the API

//create multiple DOM elements to contain the upgrades (loop)

//TODO: create DOM elements for the shop upgrades
//- create element
//- assign the value to its property (textContent)
//- append it to the DOM

// after you complete this task, you should see the upgrades in your shop-container!

//TODO: create function(s) to handle the purchase action
//the user needs a button to buy the item
//when the user clicks the button:
//subtract cost of upgrade from totalCookieCount
//add increase value to cps
//save new values in local storage

//============================================================================

//the interval

setInterval(function () {
  totalCookieCount += cps; //totalCookieCount = totalCookieCount + cps
  //update the DOM to reflect the changes in the values
  // save the values in local storage
}, 1000);
